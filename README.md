# Solo Challenge 1

Welcome to my first DevBootcamp assigned website.  This website is to be made using HTML (and now CSS too) about any given topic.  Since I'm fresh off a camping trip to La Push, WA - This will be my topic!  Enjoy :smile:

### Update #1 - 4/5/2017
I've added a hefty amount of CSS to the index file.  All of the images are in place and the font-styles have been set.  I spent a good 4 hours getting to understand how to build .svg in html and what on earth the viewBox is but now that it all makes sense...it RULES.

Still a lot of work to do in the CSS portion.

### Update #2 - 4/7/2017
Getting the footer to stay in place took a ridiculous amount of time - especially when the fix really came down to just setting the height of html.  Its in place for the most part now but I still feel that its a little off.  I also think I have WAY too many CSS declarations and that if I had planned this site out better from the beginning, I could have avoided targeting so many elements with IDs.
