# Solo Challenge 1

Welcome to my first DevBootcamp assigned website.  This website is to be made about any given topic using HTML and CSS.  Since I'm fresh off a camping trip to La Push, WA - This will be my topic!  Enjoy :smile:

### Update #1 - 4/5/2017
I've added a hefty amount of CSS to the index file.  All of the images are in place and the font-styles have been set.  I spent a good 4 hours getting to understand how to build .svg in html and what on earth the viewBox is but now that it all makes sense...it RULES.

Still a lot of work to do in the CSS portion.

### Update #2 - 4/7/2017
Getting the footer to stay in place took a ridiculous amount of time - especially when the fix really came down to just setting the height of html.  Its in place for the most part now but I still feel that its a little off.  I also think I have WAY too many CSS declarations and that if I had planned this site out better from the beginning, I could have avoided targeting so many elements with IDs.

### Update #3 - 4/11/2017
The site is now finished - I ran into a few more frustrating issues with formatting towards the end.  

1. Issue number one was getting a footer image to stay locked to the bottom.  Using a solid fill on the footer worked fine, but using a footer full width image - I couldn't make it work.  I ended up ditching it for a solid-fill bottom instead.
2. Issue number two was getting the "Friends" and "Mail List Signup" columns justified in relation to the page.  I was able to find a fix researching online using a pseudo selector, but I have no idea how that code works so until I learn it, I opted to just use margins - though i know they are off just a little bit.

I'll also add that this definitely taught me why I should plan mobile first and not the other way around - it would have been much easier if I had scaled my site out from mobile vs. building it full screen first and scaling it down to mobile.

For now...i'll call this one done :thumbsup:
